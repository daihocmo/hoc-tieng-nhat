## Phim ảnh

- **Tampopo (たんぽぽ, 1985)** A mix of unique narratives, mainly a trucker helps a Ramenya owner spiff up her Ramen.
- **The Eel (うなぎ, 1997)** A man rebuilds his life after prison, along with his pet eel.
- **After Life (ワンダフルライフ, 1998)** I recommend this the most! A group of recently-deceased people must choose their most important memory, film it, then enter that moment for eternity.
- **Kikujiro (菊次郎の夏, 1999)** A gambler helps a young boy find his long lost mother. Kitano’s in it and beautiful Hisaishi music. Both funny and touching.
- **Battle Royal (バトル・ロワイアル, 2000)** A school class fights each other to the death on an island. Popular for good reason. Watch before you watch the hunger games.
- **Eureka (ユリイカ, 2000)** Three survivors process their lives after a bus shooting. Four hours long, but feels like a trip if you get through it.
- **Taste of Tea (茶の味, 2004)** A family in rural Japan. The brother learns go to confront his crush, the sister is watched by a giant version of herself, the mother works on her anime sequence, the uncle drifts around and records music. Love this movie. So worth watching to the end.
- **Survive Style 5+ (サバイヴスタイル5＋, 2004)** Three friends, a man whose wife keep returning from the dead, an American hitman, and a family whose father thinks he’s a chicken, and a commercial writer… Be prepared. This director previously only made commercials.
- **Linda Linda Linda (2005)** Three high school girls recruit a Korean exchange student to be the singer of their rock band.
- **Tokyo Sonata (トウキョウソナタ, 2008)** A family in Tokyo deteriorates one by one, in a beautiful, overlapping kinda way.
- **Love Exposure (愛のむきだし, 2008)** Another 4 hour-er (originally, 6). Perverted, but feels epic somehow and admirable for its sheer unorthodoxy.
- **Kaiji (カイジ 人生逆転ゲーム, 2009)** Ok, based off a manga I think, but liked it. About the misadventures and mind games of a gambler trying to get out of debt.
- **I wish (奇跡, 2011)** Two brothers living in separate cities plan to run off and meet in Kumamoto where the shinkansen trains cross in order to make a wish for their families to reunite.
- **Himizu (ヒミズ, 2011)** Watch for some beautiful, poetic, violent teen angst.
- **Kirishima Thing (桐島、部活やめるってよ, 2012)** The top athlete drops out of school, and nobody knows why. Each scene follows the perspective of a different high schooler, overlapping in time.

- **More Koreeda films:** Still walking, Air doll, Like father like son, Our little sister, After the storm, the third murder, Shoplifters
- **Comedies by Shinobu Yaguchi:** Swing Girls, Waterboys, Wood Job!, Survival Family, Robo-G
- **I Are You, You Am Me (転校生, 1982)** A boy and girl fall down at a temple and switch bodies, then have to adjust to life in junior high as the opposite sex.
- **The girl who leapt through time (時をかける少女, 1983)** High school girl gets the ability to time travel.
- **A Taxing Woman (マルサの女, 1987)** A tax investigator uses various techniques to catch tax evaders. This won awards, same director as Tampopo, and there’s a sequel.
- **Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald (ラジオの時間, 1993)** Feel-good flick about a bunch of voice actors doing a live late-night radio drama that devolves into madness due to them carelessly altering the script and improvising. One of the funniest movies I've seen.
- **Blue (2001)** A friendship between two Japanese schoolgirls escalates into romance.
- **Hana & Alice (花とアリス, 2004)** Beautiful, emotional comedy-drama. Two girls gaslight a boy into thinking he has amnesia and that one of them is his girlfriend.
- **Turtles Swim Faster Than Expected (亀は意外と速く泳ぐ, 2005)** A woman finds an ad to become a spy… hard to describe but freaking amazing. Same director as Survive Style 5+.
- **Rainbow Song (虹の女神, 2006)** A man hears about the death of his close friend, sparking his recollection of the events in life they shared from meeting at a record store, shooting a short film as part of their university film club, to saying their last goodbyes. Sad, but a good movie.
- **Adrift in Tokyo (転々, 2007)** A whimsical gem: A thug offers to pay a law student’s gambling debt if he accompanies him on a trip across Tokyo.
- **I just didn’t do it (それでもボクはやっていない, 2007)** A guy’s life goes off the rails when he's falsely accused of molesting a woman on the train. Relatively easy to understand.
- **Departures (2008)** A cellist learns his true calling as a mortician.
- **Fine, fine, totally fine (全然大丈夫, 2008)** Two friends fall in love with the same girl. This movie is a real gem.
- **Instant Numa (インスタント沼, 2009)** A woman searches for her father, she finds a man running a pawn shop, all kinds of hilarious situations ensue.
- **Symbol (しんぼる, 2009)** The Spanish language plot-line follows a wrestler, and the Japanese plotline follows a man who wakes up in a plain white room, and eventually starts to set off these weird reactions from the room he's trapped in.
- **Confessions (告白, 2010)** A high school teacher confronts the students who killed her daughter. Watch for some beautiful dark revenge.
- **モテキ (2011)** This is just a silly rom-com, but I really liked it.
- **Key of life (鍵泥棒のメソッド, 2012)** A failed actor changes identities with a stranger in a bathhouse and discovers the man is an elite assassin. Witty writing, fun for learners.
- **Flowers in the shadows (陰日向に咲く, 2008)** for interweaving, melodramatic, but genuinely engaging plot threads. Coincidences, twists and redemption stories.
- **100 Yen Love (百円の恋, 20014)** A woman moves out to live on her own, working in a convenience store, then after meeting a boxer decides to take up boxing. Warning: one hard to watch sexual assault scene, but otherwise really good movie.
- **Happy Hour (ハッピーアワー, 2015)** Another 4-hour movie! A slice of life of four women in their thirties who are friends. Absolutely beautiful.
- **My father, the bride (おいしい家族, 2019)** A woman returns from Tokyo to her small island home to discover that her father has decided to live as a woman and remarry. A funny, touching, fascinating film.
- Ringu, 
- The Grudge, 
- Pulse, 
- Dark Water, 
- Suicide Club, 
- Cure 
- Battle Royale.
- For more j-horror, I highly recommend is **One Cut of the Dead (カメラを止めるな！)** which is a zombie film. 
- **Godzilla Minus One (ゴジラ-1.0)** is more kaiju than pure horror but Godzilla is absolutely terrifying in this film. It is a seriously good movie, that also covers post-war Japan and I was not expecting to get so emotional while watching it. I will say that some of the dialogue may be hard for you to parse when they go into battle plans of defeating Godzilla, but there's a lot of slice-of-life dialogue as it follows a young man trying to rebuild his life in post-war Tokyo. Regardless, I highly recommend this film as it might be my movie of the year.
- For slice-of-life, someone mentioned **Hirokazu Koreeda** and that's a great suggestion too because the acting is more natural so the dialogue will test your hearing a lot more than other films, because characters aren't just to say every word with perfected diction. He also often uses first time actors.
- Tokyo Story is his most famous film but I recommend checking out the entire "Noriko trilogy" as in some ways I like the earlier movies more but they all pack a big emotional punch (his film at first seem to be about nothing, but it very slowly ramps up the emotional intensity).
- **Late Spring (晩春, Banshun)**
- **Early Summer (麥秋, Bakushū)**
- **Tokyo Story (東京物語, Tōkyō Monogatari)**
- If you want a more modern director / film. one recent film that was really cool from a learner's perspective was [The Great Passage (舟を編む Fune Wo Amu)](https://mydramalist.com/6615-the-great-passage). 
- It's based on the book, also called 舟を編む, and it's just been made into [a spin-off TV show](https://mydramalist.com/759225-fune-wo-amu-watashi-jisho-tsukurimasu), that is now airing in Japan.
- **A Taxing Woman (マルサの女)**
- **The Funeral (お葬式)**
- "Tales of Terror from Tokyo" (怪談新耳袋, Maidan Shin Mimibukuro) series. 
- Yami Shibai (闇芝居) anime series.
- "Hell Teacher Nūbē" (地獄先生ぬ〜べ〜, Jigoku Sensei Nūbē) and 
- Ghost Stories (学校の怪談, Gakkō no Kaidan)
- "Mieruko-chan" (見える子ちゃん) is also quite good.
- Kwaidan. It's a group of four samurai-age horror stories. Altogether, it's about three hours.
- "Confessions" (告白, Kokuhaku): more of a thriller than a horror
