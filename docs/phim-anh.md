### Best live action films for learning Japanese [Resources](https://libreddit.bus-hit.me/r/LearnJapanese/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Resources%22&restrict_sr=on)

Noticed many here get most their listening from anime or dorama, while some film buffs watch older cinema (Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, etc). These are all good! There are also some great contemporary non-period films too. Wanted to craft a list of favorites from 1985 onward—good for shadowing, and simply great for watching and rewatching. These all left a powerful impact after viewing.

- **Tampopo (たんぽぽ, 1985)** A mix of unique narratives, mainly a trucker helps a Ramenya owner spiff up her Ramen.
- **The Eel (うなぎ, 1997)** A man rebuilds his life after prison, along with his pet eel.
- **After Life (ワンダフルライフ, 1998)** I recommend this the most! A group of recently-deceased people must choose their most important memory, film it, then enter that moment for eternity.
- **Kikujiro (菊次郎の夏, 1999)** A gambler helps a young boy find his long lost mother. Kitano’s in it and beautiful Hisaishi music. Both funny and touching.
- **Battle Royal (バトル・ロワイアル, 2000)** A school class fights each other to the death on an island. Popular for good reason. Watch before you watch the hunger games.
- **Eureka (ユリイカ, 2000)** Three survivors process their lives after a bus shooting. Four hours long, but feels like a trip if you get through it.
- **Taste of Tea (茶の味, 2004)** A family in rural Japan. The brother learns go to confront his crush, the sister is watched by a giant version of herself, the mother works on her anime sequence, the uncle drifts around and records music. Love this movie. So worth watching to the end.
- **Survive Style 5+ (サバイヴスタイル5＋, 2004)** Three friends, a man whose wife keep returning from the dead, an American hitman, and a family whose father thinks he’s a chicken, and a commercial writer… Be prepared. This director previously only made commercials.
- **Linda Linda Linda (2005)** Three high school girls recruit a Korean exchange student to be the singer of their rock band.
- **Tokyo Sonata (トウキョウソナタ, 2008)** A family in Tokyo deteriorates one by one, in a beautiful, overlapping kinda way.
- **Love Exposure (愛のむきだし, 2008)** Another 4 hour-er (originally, 6). Perverted, but feels epic somehow and admirable for its sheer unorthodoxy.
- **Kaiji (カイジ 人生逆転ゲーム, 2009)** Ok, based off a manga I think, but liked it. About the misadventures and mind games of a gambler trying to get out of debt.
- **I wish (奇跡, 2011)** Two brothers living in separate cities plan to run off and meet in Kumamoto where the shinkansen trains cross in order to make a wish for their families to reunite.
- **Himizu (ヒミズ, 2011)** Watch for some beautiful, poetic, violent teen angst.
- **Kirishima Thing (桐島、部活やめるってよ, 2012)** The top athlete drops out of school, and nobody knows why. Each scene follows the perspective of a different high schooler, overlapping in time.

- **Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald (ラジオの時間, 1993)** Feel-good flick about a bunch of voice actors doing a live late-night radio drama that devolves into madness due to them carelessly altering the script and improvising. One of the funniest movies I've seen.
- **Blue (2001)** A friendship between two Japanese schoolgirls escalates into romance.
- **Hana & Alice (花とアリス, 2004)** Beautiful, emotional comedy-drama. Two girls gaslight a boy into thinking he has amnesia and that one of them is his girlfriend.
- **Turtles Swim Faster Than Expected (亀は意外と速く泳ぐ, 2005)** A woman finds an ad to become a spy… hard to describe but freaking amazing. Same director as Survive Style 5+.
- **Rainbow Song (虹の女神, 2006)** A man hears about the death of his close friend, sparking his recollection of the events in life they shared from meeting at a record store, shooting a short film as part of their university film club, to saying their last goodbyes. Sad, but a good movie.

- **I just didn’t do it (それでもボクはやっていない, 2007)** A guy’s life goes off the rails when he's falsely accused of molesting a woman on the train. Relatively easy to understand.

- **Confessions (告白, 2010)** A high school teacher confronts the students who killed her daughter. Watch for some beautiful dark revenge.
- **モテキ (2011)** This is just a silly rom-com, but I really liked it.
- **Key of life (鍵泥棒のメソッド, 2012)** A failed actor changes identities with a stranger in a bathhouse and discovers the man is an elite assassin. Witty writing, fun for learners.
- **Flowers in the shadows (陰日向に咲く, 2008)** for interweaving, melodramatic, but genuinely engaging plot threads. Coincidences, twists and redemption stories.
- **100 Yen Love (百円の恋, 20014)** A woman moves out to live on her own, working in a convenience store, then after meeting a boxer decides to take up boxing. Warning: one hard to watch sexual assault scene, but otherwise really good movie.
- **Happy Hour (ハッピーアワー, 2015)** Another 4-hour movie! A slice of life of four women in their thirties who are friends. Absolutely beautiful.
- **My father, the bride (おいしい家族, 2019)** A woman returns from Tokyo to her small island home to discover that her father has decided to live as a woman and remarry. A funny, touching, fascinating film.

You can also search what won the Japan Academy Prize of the year. Please watch these—those I've seen are great and I didn’t do them justice. Thanks all for your good finds and descriptions.

**What would you add to the list?**


Ringu, The Grudge, Pulse, Dark Water, Suicide Club, Cure, Battle Royale.

Yeah, I second that recommendation. Japanese horror movies are fairly easy to follow.

Also consider reading the novels that those movies were based on. When I started to read Japanese novels, I found horror novels easier to read compared to other genres since it's mostly slice-of-life-based. The Ring trilogy was one of the first adult novels I read in Japanese. Battle Royale is really fun too (it's in print only so you'll have to buy a physical version of the novel).

For more j-horror, I highly recommend is **One Cut of the Dead (カメラを止めるな！)** which is a zombie film. That is one of recent favorites. Even thought I was getting jaded by zombie movies, but this is really creative take on the genre. A horror-comedy movie about a director trying to make a zombie movie all in one cut with no edits.

There are some huge twists so try to avoid reading reviews and watch it blind. I will say that even if you do not like it, watch it till at least the halfway point.

**Godzilla Minus One (ゴジラ-1.0)** is more kaiju than pure horror but Godzilla is absolutely terrifying in this film. It is a seriously good movie, that also covers post-war Japan and I was not expecting to get so emotional while watching it. I will say that some of the dialogue may be hard for you to parse when they go into battle plans of defeating Godzilla, but there's a lot of slice-of-life dialogue as it follows a young man trying to rebuild his life in post-war Tokyo. Regardless, I highly recommend this film as it might be my movie of the year.

For slice-of-life, someone mentioned **Hirokazu Koreeda** and that's a great suggestion too because the acting is more natural so the dialogue will test your hearing a lot more than other films, because characters aren't just to say every word with perfected diction. He also often uses first time actors.

He's inspired by the great **Yasijiru Ozu**, considered to be one of Japanese best filmmakers along with Akira Kurosara. Ozu pioneered this slow more naturalist way of making movies, and its very Japanese in the way the scenes are shot and edited, often using low camera angles.

Tokyo Story is his most famous film but I recommend checking out the entire "Noriko trilogy" as in some ways I like the earlier movies more but they all pack a big emotional punch (his film at first seem to be about nothing, but it very slowly ramps up the emotional intensity).

- **Late Spring (晩春, Banshun)**
- **Early Summer (麥秋, Bakushū)**
- **Tokyo Story (東京物語, Tōkyō Monogatari)**

If you want a more modern director / film. one recent film that was really cool from a learner's perspective was [The Great Passage (舟を編む Fune Wo Amu)](https://mydramalist.com/6615-the-great-passage). It won many awards in Japan. It's charming movie about a small team of people trying to make a new Japanese dictionary. Yeah, the plot might sound boring, but it's a really charming film. Since the characters all love the Japanese language, I learned a lot of interesting words, especially dictionary-related words.

It's based on the book, also called 舟を編む, and it's just been made into [a spin-off TV show](https://mydramalist.com/759225-fune-wo-amu-watashi-jisho-tsukurimasu), that is now airing in Japan.

Other suggestions:

**Juzo Itami** films:

- **Tampopo (タンポポ)**
- **A Taxing Woman (マルサの女)**
- **The Funeral (お葬式)**

They are all slice-of-life and he was one of Japanese most creative directors, often mixing genres together. Tampopo is his most famous film, a wild and funny food adventure that will make you hungry, but I recommend checking out his other films as well.


There are a ton of fantastic j-horror films out there, but for a beginner language learner, I think shorter media might be more helpful. In particular, I'm thinking of the "Tales of Terror from Tokyo" (怪談新耳袋, Maidan Shin Mimibukuro) series. Technically, each story is about five minutes, but there's a lot of them. They'll be the same length as a full length film if you binge them all. Each story is self-contained and to the point, but there's plenty of useful vocabulary you can use in real life.

There's also "13 Real Asian Horror Stories," also known as "13 Japanese Horror Stories Based on Real Life Events."

You could also look into the Yami Shibai (闇芝居) anime series. These stories are also 5 minutes, 13 episodes per season at 9 seasons.

Sticking with anime, I hear "Hell Teacher Nūbē" (地獄先生ぬ〜べ〜, Jigoku Sensei Nūbē) and Ghost Stories (学校の怪談, Gakkō no Kaidan) are good for full-length 30-minute episodes.

- "Mieruko-chan" (見える子ちゃん) is also quite good.

- Kwaidan. It's a group of four samurai-age horror stories. Altogether, it's about three hours.

- "Confessions" (告白, Kokuhaku): more of a thriller than a horror
