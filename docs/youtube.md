It's a group channel with 6 members which probably influenced most of the main trends on Japanese YouTube today, for example hard subtitles and sound effects.

He fishes and eats bugs pretty much, while taking lots of inspiration from orochimaru from naruto, mainly in the form of his voice. Can't recommend to people who find bugs disgusting though. If you get invested like me, check out the second channel おろちんゆーの素揚げ.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/youtube_channels_files/unnamed_062.jpg) |

| [QuizKnock](https://www.youtube.com/@QuizKnock) | Quiz    | Group channel made up of almost entirely 東大 graduates. I think ふくらP might be the only guy in the main cast who didn't go to 東大.

| [じぶん流DIYちゃんねる](https://www.youtube.com/@jibunryu-diy)  | DIY     | Guy fixing up an akiya to retire in 10 years later in Ibaraki, Japan. The house renovation is really interesting. The only downside is all of the videos are subtitles with music and there is no voiceover, but if you can get over this I'd still recommend it. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/youtube_channels_files/unnamed_007.jpg) |
