# Giới thiệu

Reading as immersion material is particularly key in increasing vocabulary, but after focusing on listening for a while, it can be daunting.

[Graded readers](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/o7x7ha/2021_updated_free_tadoku_graded_reader_pdfs_1796/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) can be boring despite how helpful they might be, but Light Novels can look like a daunting wall of text for many, even at lower levels. Manga simply doesn’t have the text density that books can offer.
  

I think there’s a great potential in choosing books focused on the 児童 market, from 小学生 to 中学生。With shorter sentences and often less complicated vocabulary, they can still offer stories interesting enough to grab and retain our attention as learners.


I’ve compiled a list of 文庫 collection names, for easy searching for children’s books that might help getting a foot in the door to reading - once you get the ball rolling, it’s a whole lot less intimidating.


(This is not a comprehensive list, and I may have missed some well-known collections)

  

## Mẹo trước khi bắt đầu

- [Cài Yomitan](https://learnjapanese.moe/yomichan/) - Đây là một tiện ích trên trình duyệt giúp tra từ siêu nhanh.
    
- Sử dụng [Ttsu Reader](https://reader.ttsu.app/) để đọc các tệp EPUBs, vì nó hỗ trợ Yomitan cực tốt.
            
- Know when to move on from something that’s too easy - you want your reading to be just challenging enough, so that you’re always learning. Furigana on every kanji won’t ever help you read kanji.
    
- Don’t feel obligated to finish a book if it’s not interesting to you.
    
- Have a good foundation in listening - you are likely to [subvocalise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization) when reading, so knowing how the language sounds (including pitch accent, if it’s a skill you wish to acquire), is important.  

This won’t “ruin your accent”, but being able to associate what you’re reading with the sounds of the language will significantly improve linking the two skills in your head, so that you’ll more easily be able to understand hearing words you’ve only read before.

Alongside the last point with listening, I’d like to suggest a point that I haven’t heard other learners bring up before - getting used to narrative/descriptive content. 

Many people start immersing with anime, and other listening-focused materials, however this is often mostly dialogue; even text in manga is primarily speech.

I personally advocate for listening to some children’s tales, and getting used to the large amount of narration in the story - it is the bulk of the grammar you will come across in fiction books. 

I highly recommend these two playlists, which offer both hard and soft-subs (great for Yomitan), for getting used to how non-dialogue content sounds and reads in Japanese:

- [日本の昔ばなし・アニメ シリーズ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1DnK3_eexijBUgFRq9Vlc1mW3gQv6gPf) - Japanese Folktales
    
- [世界の名作童話アニメ シリーズ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1DnK3_eexigbTRh6rIZIIY8MJfvnlw9Q) - Famous Folktales from Around the World
