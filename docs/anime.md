| Ranking | Title | Difficulty Explanation  | Picture |
| ------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| Very Easy   | わかば＊ガール  | Wakaba speaks in keigo but this is the only difficulty, especially considering the episodes are just shorts. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_007.jpg) |
| Very Easy   | ご注文はうさぎですか？  | Nothing much to say here, very simple slice of life. Even if you don't understand a particular dialogue you can still get healed by the cuteness.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_040.jpg) |
| Very Easy   | しろくまカフェ  | It's very easy because all the dialogues are slow, use only basic grammar, and the topics are almost all about slice-of-life content. It revolves around two stories each episode, so the predictability of the narrative is very short with the beginning, middle, and end of a narrative in less than 15 minutes each.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_020.jpg) |
| Very Easy   | 怪談レストラン  | Each episode is a collection of three or two short, simple ghost stories. Vocabulary is mostly basic, predominantly slice of life or schoold related. The only more challenging bit is the intro to episodes where each of the stories is briefly introduced as if it were a restaurant dish using some keigo. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_042.jpg) |
| Easy   | けいおん!    | Easy cute girls doing cute things anime, some music vocabulary but not much. Good vibes, even if you don't get anything you'll still feel all warm and fuzzy inside.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_037.jpg) |
| Easy   | こみっくがーるず | Cute girls doing cute things (CGDCT) with easy to understand language.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_061.jpg) |
| Easy   | ゆるキャン△   | Dialogue is easy, the important parts are the atmosphere, mood and visuals.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_069.jpg) |
| Easy   | のんのんびより  | Easy dialogue, the pace is great and the characters don't speak too fast either.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_006.jpg) |
| Easy   | 聲の形 | Made it easier from the fact that they sometimes use their hands to communicate. It's a film so it's not too long either which helps.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_041.jpg) |
| Easy   | ゆるゆり| Very easy SoL vocabulary, recommended for a beginner.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_029.jpg) |
| Easy   | からかい上手の高木さん  | It uses simple expressions, easy grammar and both protagonists speak slowly so you can grasp the meaning of words very easily. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_051.jpg) |
| Easy   | 女神のカフェテラス| It's easy because all of the dialogues are simple, most of the words are very common, and the grammar is very basic. It's not very easy because sometimes the dialogue between the girls and the guy can overlap, becoming a fast-paced dialogue. I would definitely recommend it for beginners, but the speed of the dialogue is certainly higher than, say, Takagi San.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_019.jpg) |
| Easy   | たまこまーけっと | Simple slice of life/CGDCT vocabulary, nothing too hard going on here.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_050.jpg) |
| Easy   | あの日見た花の名前を僕達はまだ知らない。  | Simple slice of life, no specific terminology, half of the show is kids speaking so it's easier to understand, hardest part is not crying at the end. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_002.png) |
| Easy   | planetarian ～ちいさなほしのゆめ～    | Easy anime movie, nothing much to say outside of the fact that the robot speaks in a little convoluted way using 敬語.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_032.jpg) |
| Easy   | planetarian～星の人～  | See above.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed.jpg)|
| Easy   | 宇宙よりも遠い場所| Outside of some characters speaking a bit fast from time to time, this is mostly easy. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_027.jpg) |
| Easy   | ぼくたちは勉強ができない | Very simple harem SoL stuff, nothing hard here.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_015.jpg) |
| Easy   | 僕は友達が少ない | Once again a standard slice of life romcom harem anime. Nothing too spectacular to note here, all the characters speak pretty clearly and the subject matter isn't hard either.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_049.jpg) |
| Easy   | 干物妹！うまるちゃん   | Standard slice of life fare, Umaru can speak a bit fast in certain parts and her friend has an accent from time to time. Other than this, nothing much to worry about.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_021.jpg) |
| Easy   | 阿波連さんははかれない  | There is nothing too difficult to see here, it's mostly slice of life vocabulary with some occasional tangents by the main character when he's in delusion-mode looking at Aharen-san.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_067.jpg) |
| Easy   | トニカクカワイイ | Very rarely some business terms are used but it's mostly simple romcom vocabulary and sentence structure.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_058.jpg) |
| Easy   | Kanon    | Pretty simple, it's a standard dating sim adaptation. The plot becomes important in the latter part of the anime so it's slightly more difficult than general slice of life anime, but it's still easy.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_010.jpg) |
| Easy   | お兄ちゃんだけど愛さえあれば関係ないよねっ | Simple harem romcom, the dialogue isn't too hard and the vocabulary is simple.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_043.jpg) |
| Easy   | WORKING!!| Slice of life full of comedy so the vocabulary and grammar aren't too hard. There's very little plot until later on which means you can just enjoy the comedy without caring too much at first.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_055.jpg) |
| Easy   | まじもじるるも  | Pretty easy slice of life anime with a slight fantasy twist. The dialogues are easy and the plot isn't too important outside of the last few episodes.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_034.jpg) |
| Easy   | バクマン。    | Some manga terminology, the rest is pretty easy since it is a slice of life mostly.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_005.jpg) |
| Easy   | Buddy Daddies| Mostly slice of life vocab and dialogue I don't remember anything that was too difficult.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_033.jpg) |
| Easy   | 可愛いだけじゃない式守さん| Slice of life vocabulary, nothing too hard to see here.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_071.jpg) |
| Easy   | 月がきれい    | Simple romance story with no real twists so very easy to follow. Characters use simple daily life language.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_018.jpg) |
| Easy   | コタローは一人暮らし   | Slice of life without too much complicated vocab, though the main character kotarou speaks weird might be a bit hard to get used to but it's not too bad. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_012.jpg) |
| Easy   | ゲーマーズ！   | A lot of gamer slang is used, but the rest is fine.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_008.jpg) |
| Easy   | 彼女、お借りします| The usual romance vocabulary, nothing much to say here.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_016.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | ヒナまつり    | Extremely funny with simple dialogues. The only difficulty is the slight yakuza slang from time to time. Other than that, decent especially since Hina speaks slowly in a calm voice.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_039.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 四月は君の嘘   | A lot of music words but other than that the conversations are pretty easy.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_025.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | はじめの一歩 THE FIGHTING!  | Main difficulty comes from the boxing terms but they are explained accordingly, so it's still decently easy. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_059.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 日常  | Overall not too hard, although some references can be hard to catch. Even if you don't understand anything you can usually get what's going on from the visuals. You can watch this without understanding anything and still have a good time.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_068.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | BNA ビー・エヌ・エー | It has some sci-fi/scientific explainations but other than that it is pretty pretty simple.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_070.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | とらドラ！    | Mostly SoL/romance vocabulary. Nothing too hard to follow, though there is an underlying plot.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_062.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | だがしかし    | A few dagashi words but nothing too hard. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_046.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 中二病でも恋がしたい!  | The only hard parts are when the characters go into chuunibyou mode. The rest of the dialogue is standard slice of life romcom stuff, so nothing too hard. If you want to understand everything, it's closer to medium.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_017.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 魔法少女まどか★マギカ  | Deconstruction of the magical girl genre which means you get some fantasy vocabulary but nothing much, mostly mahou shoujo/witch stuff. It's not too hard but the plot is important so if you miss stuff you'll be confused.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_065.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 坂道のアポロン  | The vocabulary and sentence structures aren't very hard, although there is obviously some jazz terminology thrown in there.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_053.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 斉木楠雄のΨ難  | The characters can talk a bit fast but other than this should be fine.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_060.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST | Has some military vocabulary here and there but overall it's fairly easy from a language perspective with fairly standard vocabulary and grammar otherwise.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_056.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | ぼっち・ざ・ろっく！   | Mostly slice of life conversations, however there is some music terminology that are used and many jokes, some of which may be hard to understand.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_066.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 青春ブタ野郎はバニーガール先輩の夢を見ない | The usual SoL vocabulary but with the addition of occasional quantum mechanics terms and concepts.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_031.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | 無職転生| Nothing too difficult, standard fantasy setting with standard fantasy vocabulary. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_022.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | Bartender| The anime is episodical so even if you don't understand one episode, the next one is mostly not affected. Some cocktail terminology you need to pick up but the leisurely pace and mood make it easier.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_030.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium | スラムダンク   | The main difficulty comes from the various basketball terms, but they are usually explained when they're introduced which makes it easier.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_047.jpg) |
| Medium | ノーゲーム・ノーライフ  | Involves psychological battles where the ability to follow along is pivotal to the enjoyment. Some characters can also speak fairly quickly sometimes. That being said, there isn't too much to say specifically about the vocabulary and grammar being used as it's fairly standard.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_048.jpg) |
| Medium | モンスター    | The difficulty varies from episode to episode, with some of them having a lot more medical jargon and philosophical terms. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_064.jpg) |
| Medium | プロメア| Sci-fi action anime film, has some challenging bits but overall is fairly normal. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_044.jpg) |
| Medium | 異世界薬局    | The story is as straightforward as it gets with an isekai but be prepared not only for intermittent keigo and fantasy vocabulary befitting the setting but also (and most importantly) quite a lot of words related to (real-world) medicine, health conditions, illnesses, etc.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_003.jpg) |
| Medium | てーきゅう    | Slice of life shitpost anime, episodes are super short so easy to digest.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_026.jpg) |
| Medium | ヴィンランド・サガ| Harder than basic romcoms and the likes, but not too difficult either. Has some fantasy/historical vocabulary.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_063.jpg) |
| Medium | Serial Experiments Lain    | While the anime itself is hard to understand with a lot of symbolism, the actual speech isn't too hard for a good part of the anime. Some of the latter scenes can be a bit harder to understand, but the language used isn't too difficult.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_011.jpg) |
| Medium | ハンター×ハンター| The arcs themselves can vary a lot in difficulty, from easy-medium to medium-hard so medium seems decent as a difficulty marker. There's shonen lingo as well as general fantasy vocabulary.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_054.jpg) |
| Medium | デス・パレード  | The main character uses keigo and the subject matter is more complex than basic slice of life or romcom anime, but it is still not extremely difficult. While the plot is important, the various games are interesting on their own.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_009.jpg) |
| Medium | ピンポン THE ANIMATION| While the vocabulary isn't too complicated, some characters speak in Chinese with Japanese subtitles and the dialogues can get a bit philosophical at times. Obviously there's some ping pong terminology, although ping pong isn't actually the main theme of this anime. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_035.jpg) |
| Medium | 地獄学園| One character speaks like a samurai, there is some wordplay and the characters can talk a bit fast at times. Overall not too hard, but not quite very easy either. Still, the comedy is so good that even if you don't fully understand what's going on you might like it nonetheless.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_052.jpg) |
| Medium | ブルーロック   | Some characters have their own speaking style where add things to the ends of their sentences or use slightly rarer words so it can be a touch harder to pick up on what they say.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_028.jpg) |
| Medium | 闘牌伝説アカギ　闇に舞い降りた天才 | Knowing Mahjong is an absolute requirement for this one or you will be completely lost. Other than this, medium difficulty.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_013.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard | 逆境無頼カイジ Ultimate Survivor  | Just like above (it's the same author), this centers on mahjong with a strong focus on psychology. It is slightly more difficult though, because you need to pretty accurately understand the rules of each gamble in order to fully enjoy it and there is fairly uncommon vocabulary used by the narrator in Kaiji's particular style of writing. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_045.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard | 約束のネバーランド| The grammar is very complicated sometimes, and the vocabulary is not that easy. However, the narrative is clear as water, and the dialogues are very well written. It seems like you're reading a novel only made with dialogues. With Violet, even if the vocabulary is sometimes abstract (because of the story), you can almost always keep understanding because of the clearly written dialogue.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_014.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard | 新世紀エヴァンゲリオン  | The anime varies in difficult, in some episodes it is rather easy, towards the end it becomes pretty difficult with intricate dialogue discussing somewhat deep ideas. The mecha and technological terms can be a bit hard at first as well.  <br>  <br>The rebuilds (movies for Evangelion) are roughly of the same difficulty. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_024.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard | ヱヴァンゲリヲン新劇場版:序    | See above.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_002.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard | 魔法科高校の劣等生| Miyuki speaks in very polite speech, lots of technical words, the magic system is very complete but also technological in nature and thus sometimes a bit hard to follow.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_038.jpg) |
| Hard   | さよなら絶望先生 | Constant cultural references, tricky Japanese from time to time with a weird cast makes this one harder than your average anime.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_004.jpg) |
| Very Hard   | 範馬刃牙 SON OF OGRE  | The anime is full of phraseology, long dialogues that use words or vocabulary that are not commonly used. In addition, everything is pronounced quite quickly and if you do not hear it, you can miss the whole essence of the dialog or monologue. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_036.jpg) |
| Very Hard   | 刀語  | Edo- era vocabulary, complicated samurai imagery with episodes that are unusually long for anime. The plot is not exactly episodical but each episode usually focuses on a different sword with a lot of historical and samurai terms. Interesting and witty dialogue that tends to go on and on making it difficult to follow.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_023.jpg) |
| Very Hard   | 四畳半神話大系  | Extremely fast-paced dialogues, constant references to literary works, obscure cultural references and philosophical considerations all dumped into one big pot. It's already difficult in English, so good luck in Japanese. Really good though.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed.png)|
| Very Hard   | 平家物語| Set in 12th century Japan and follows the Taira clan and Minamoto clan. All characters use old Japanese and archaic terms making it extremely hard to follow along without subtitles, and requires lots of experience and possibly some historical knowledge to be able to follow along with subtitles if you dont want to do a lot of lookups. This show isn't good immersion material for improving your language skills as its all archaic Japanese, but is a gold mine to mine kanji. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/anime_files/unnamed_057.jpg) |
