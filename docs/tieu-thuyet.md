| Very Easy      | 娘じゃなくて私〈ママ〉が好きなの!? | Nothing complicated going on, simple vocabulary with simple grammar. Recommended for beginners. Every volume has a short summary of the story so far, making it even easier. It does not get harder as the series goes on.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_080.jpg) |
| Very Easy      | また、同じ夢を見ていた  | Very easy vocabulary, it's mostly a monologue from a primary school student.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_046.jpg) |
| Very Easy      | 迷子になっていた幼女を助けたら、お隣に住む美少女留学生が家に遊びに来るようになった件について | Simple subject. A lot of the book is a conversation to a child or about one.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_049.jpg) |
| Very Easy-Easy | ぜんぶ、藍色だった。   | Half the length of most LNs, with very limited romance (and painting) focused vocabulary and overall short sentences. But the story is not entirely chronological and there are some twists to it, hence the bump up from the easiest difficulty. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_033.jpg) |
| Easy    | コンビニ人間| Award- winning book about a コンビニ employee, so features a lot of コンビニ related vocabulary which is mostly easy. Decently short too, around 60k characters.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed.png)     |
| Easy    | 世界から猫が消えたなら  | Pretty clear plot structure with decently easy grammar and vocabulary make it easy to follow.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_023.jpg) |

| Easy    | 天国に涙はいらない    | Very simple and straightforward, it has some christian vocab but basically everything has furigana.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_043.jpg) |
| Easy    | 眠れない夜は羊を探して  | The limited length of each story forces the author to get to the point fast. Vocabulary is pretty much pure slice of life but sometimes it does dip briefly into topics that aren't explored in your typical beginner light novel.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_060.jpg) |
| Easy    | 僕は僕の書いた小説を知らない     | Most sentences are not long, no difficult vocab, pleasant writing style.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_083.jpg) |
| Easy    | にせものロマンス     | Vocabulary is limited to basic school and romance stuff so very easy but the story is told via alternating perspectives of the two MCs and there are some light deception shenanigans going on, so you have to pay a bit of attention not to get lost as to where the characters stand, metaphorically speaking. But overall an easy read.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_028.jpg) |
| Easy    | ラブコメ漫画に入ってしまったので、推しの負けヒロインを全力で幸せにする     | A good starter light novel. Very simple vocabulary and writing.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_020.jpg) |

| Easy    | あひる   | Slice of life setting with simple grammar and common words. Consists of three loosely related short stories.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_017.jpg) |
| Easy    | 隣の席の佐藤さん     | Easy and pleasant to read, no hard vocab, chill slice of life romance consisting of two volumes. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_076.jpg) |
| Easy    | 父と私の桜尾通り商店街  | Same author and setting as あひる above, therefore it's pretty much the same in terms of difficulty.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_010.jpg) |
| Easy    | 余命一年と宣告された僕が、余命半年の君と出会った話 | Decently easy light novel, the vocabulary is easy even though the setting is heavy.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_036.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | とんでもスキルで異世界放浪メシ    | If you don’t know anything about Japanese cooking, or cooking in general, it’s going to be slightly more difficult. Other than that it uses mostly simple language except for some very few characters.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_003.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | お隣の天使様にいつの間にか駄目人間にされていた件  | The writing isn't very difficult outside of maybe some keigo expressions from the female MC.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_025.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 嫌われる勇気| Some words are not the most common. The sentences in the arguments follow some very clear patterns that once you get used to it it goes smoothly. It also features more "advanced" grammar like what would be considered JLPT N2-N1 but that is actually very easy to understand in context and it's nice to see it applied in an argument.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_065.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 王女様がメイドに監禁される話     | Simple writing style, uncomplicated story in a generic fantasy setting. The only thing that stands out is keigo used by one of the MCs and typical fantasy vocabulary. If you're at least a bit familiar with the genre vocabulary though, it'll be an easy read.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_051.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | ぼくは明日、昨日のきみとデートする  | Written for adults so it might be a bit harder vocab-wise though it is still somewhat easy due to being a romance novel.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_081.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 転生したら剣でした    | The writing style is easy and pleasant to read, typical isekai vocabulary used but there are also some rare words here and there and you might struggle a bit with skill names because there's no furigana included for most of them.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed.jpg)     |
| Easy-Medium    | 夏へのトンネル、さよならの出口    | Good beginner pick, includes some supernatural elements but is quite easy to read. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_015.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | ほうかごがかり      | The story is set in school, vocabulary thus covers mostly school or slice of life topics, and (rarely) painting. What bumps up the difficulty slightly is the number of characters to track, occasional whole paragraphs dedicated to colorful environment descriptions using longer sentences, and more detailed, albeit rare, character monologues. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_006.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 琥珀の秋、0秒の旅    | Writing style is not difficult to comprehend, but different locations and prefectures are mentioned throughout the novel so you might feel a bit confused if you don't know Japan's geography at a basic level.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_007.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 半分の月がのぼる空    | There are two versions, the OG from Dengeki, and one released from a non LN label (文春文庫). The original is very easy to read with simple vocab, short sentences, but doesn't have a digital version. The second one has a digital version but it is heavily rewritten with 伊勢弁 into 4 books and no illustrations so it is a bit harder to read than the Dengeki version.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_072.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 無職転生  | Very simple sentences with a fairly narrow vocabulary considering it's fantasy.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_003.png) |
| Easy-Medium    | 青春ブタ野郎| Very light romance LN with some supernatural elements.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_078.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | ブギーポップは笑わない  | Easy sentences, the vocabulary isn't too difficult either.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_048.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | ひげを剃る、そして女子高生を拾う。  | Mostly plain sentences, not too abstract with generous furigana.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_042.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 女同士とかありえないでしょと言い張る女の子を、百日間で徹底的に落とす百合のお話 | Nothing really stands out except some descriptive terms for colors/clothing may be hard to look up.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_082.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 本好きの下剋上      | Has a ジュニア文庫 printing which makes it more approachable with a full suite of ruby/furigana thrown in for help, and is written quite approachably.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_068.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | コンビニ強盗から助けた地味店員が、同じクラスのうぶで可愛いギャルだった     | Nothing too difficult here, the grammar is pretty easy overall and the vocab is mostly slice of life stuff.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_053.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | NHKにようこそ!    | The author likes to use some yoji but other than that nothing too crazy.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_047.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 魔女の旅々 | Books are divided with many different stories. Somewhat easier than キノの旅 due to more SoL/Fantasy content/vocab. The writing in first person also makes it easier to get used to.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_016.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 冴えない彼女の育てかた  | Standard harem romcom fare with some simple doujinshi vocab. Nothing too bad, could be used as a first light novel.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_044.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがない   | Overall easy writing style but you might not realize what is an expression/idiom.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_055.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 灰と幻想のグリムガル  <br>level.1 ささやき、詠唱、祈り、目覚めよ | Some chuuni vocab and medieval weapons vocabulary.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_018.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | きのうの春で、君を待つ  | The writing style itself is not difficult, but there are lots of time leaps involved so you might get confused by the order of events if you don't follow the story closely.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_019.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 顔さえよければいい教室  | While this is decently easy, it has a pretty heavy focus on show business/entertainment which makes it slightly harder than a beginner recommendation, but still approachable.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_079.jpg) |
| Easy-Medium    | 時々ボソッとロシア語でデレる隣のアーリャさん    | Surprisingly difficult in terms of sentence length, but nothing else is difficult. The vocabulary is mostly slice of life stuff, the grammar is easy.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_037.jpg) |
| Medium  | 丘の家のミッキー【おかみきシリーズ】 | Longer sentence length (especially due to the use of parentheses) with some outdated vocabulary from time to time.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_070.jpg) |
| Medium  | 恋に至る病 | The sentences are easy to read even though it uses some pretty rare vocabulary at times.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_035.jpg) |
| Medium  | サマーウォーズ      | The sentences are usually long and can be hard to follow for a beginner with some harder vocab from time to time. The story can also be all over the place at least in the first few parts.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_026.jpg) |
| Medium  | ノルウェイの森      | Longer sentence length, pretty long novel too compared to something like light novels. The topic matter is handled in a more indirect manner. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_011.jpg) |
| Medium  | キノの旅 —the Beautiful World—| The books are divided into small stories with different perspectives and style. Grammar is quite straightforward despite some long monologues here and there but the amount of vocab will pose a challenge. For instance, depending on the story there might be military or scientific vocabulary.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_069.jpg) |
| Medium  | イリヤの空、UFOの夏  | It's not hard to follow but it does have higher vocab than your average LN, the writing is very striking and peculiar so wouldn't recommend it until having read a few other stuff at least.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_045.jpg) |
| Medium  | つめたいオゾン      | The writing is very straightforward but it does have some very long sentences and uncommon words here and there (at least compared to random LNs).   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_031.jpg) |
| Medium  | 鉄コミュニケイション   | Same as イリヤ above (same writer). Not hard to follow but the writing is very speculiar so you should a few other books first.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_030.jpg) |
| Medium  | 左巻キ式ラストリゾート  | Nothing too complicated language-wise but not extremely straightfoward either.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_058.jpg) |
| Medium  | Re:ゼロから始める異世界生活    | Average fantasy light novel difficulty.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_002.jpg) |
| Medium  | 海辺のカフカ| Sentences are pretty easy for a literary fiction work. Vocabulary has nothing particularly worth mentioning.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_050.jpg) |
| Medium  | 霊媒探偵城塚翡翠     | Detailed descriptions of environments and lines of logic that the reader must be able to understand to keep up with the mysteries. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_012.jpg) |
| Medium  | 裏世界ピクニック     | Scifi/scientific concepts and some more advanced vocabulary, but nothing crazy.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_077.jpg) |
| Medium  | なぜロジカルな人はメンタルが強いのか？| Average sentences but there are some baseball and mahjong references.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_075.jpg) |
| Medium  | やはり俺の青春ラブコメはまちがっている| Quite a few cultural references, especially to Chiba prefecture. The main character is quite cynical and tends to go on somewhat long tirades. Other than this, pretty alright. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_013.jpg) |
| Medium  | むかし僕が死んだ家    | Some vocabulary that's fallen a bit out of use, otherwise relatively straight forward.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_054.jpg) |
| Medium  | 告白    | It mixes writing styles across the whole book, with some of them being harder and some being much easier.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_008.jpg) |
| Medium  | 岸辺露伴は戯れない    | The main character is pretentious and that tone is established in the dialog and descriptions through uncommon words; it's a short story collection so there's a lot of new vocabulary every 60 pages or so.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_052.jpg) |
| Medium  | 竜殺しのブリュンヒルド  | Vocabulary on the more advanced side, fantasy story that can be harder to follow at times, and rare but present more poetic bits. If you're familiar with the prequel, I heard  <br>SukaMoka is about the same difficulty. Not a beginner recommended light novel series.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_041.jpg) |
| Medium  | 響け！ユーフォ二アム   | Dialogue has written Kansai-ben that might be difficult to get used to and there's lots of music vocab, but it also makes it THE best story for mining music vocab.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_038.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | ノーゲーム・ノーライフ  | Some characters have very strong dialect or talk in an old fashioned way, writing style is not straightforward, many references to other media can be seen throughout the novel.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_066.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | 薬屋のひとりごと     | Japanese light novel based on a Chinese background, lots of old Japanese vocab is used. Authors employ a wide range of vocab and expressions that add to the difficulty. Even the character names will throw you off because they use the Chinese pronounciation in the furigana instead of Japanese.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_014.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | 刀語    | Has some harder words/kanji for ability names and the characters speak in an old fashioned way occasionally, but otherwise very readable. Does include a bunch of wordplay though which intermediate learners and below might not be able to spot. Experience with chuuni style games might make this slightly easier.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_074.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | 魔法科高校の劣等生    | Complete magic system, protagonists use keigo constantly, lots of fights with difficult vocabualries, extensive descriptions (especially of trains and public transportations for some reason) make this a bit of a tough read for a beginner.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_032.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | 化物語   | Written by Nisioin so expect clever dialogue with word play and a lot of cultural references, making it harder than average to fully comprehend.     | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_064.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | Re：ゼロから始める異世界生活    | Standard isekai and fantasy vocabulary but relatively long sentences with decently hard structures. Takes a bit of time to get used to,| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_057.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | 恋する寄生虫| The main difficulty is that there are a lot of technical words on pathological conditions and parasites.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_071.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | 羅生門   | Old kanji, old grammar make this harder than your average novel, but it is still understandable to more advanced learners. It's a classic for a reason though.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_022.jpg) |
| Medium-Hard    | 妖氛録（中島敦）     | Written in an oldish style, has some hard words, not too difficult to read past that. Extremely short. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_040.jpg) |
| Hard    | Fate/Zero    | Sentences are challenging and the author uses a wide range of vocabulary.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_059.jpg) |
| Hard    | 幼女戦記  | Challenging isekai light novel involving politics, war and some fantasy elements.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_067.jpg) |
| Hard    | 人間失格  | Old readings that aren't used anymore, old things that aren't common anymore, extremely long phrases where you have to pay attention to the whole sentence to understand anything by the end of it. Old forms of verbs that aren't really used anymore either. Excerpts of translated poetry that you can't find in the original to compare as it's actually a unique interpretation of some japanese writer. Tough read. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_002.png) |
| Hard    | ロスジェネの逆襲     | Harder than your average novel. The novel has a lot of formal business, corporate and economic terms. It also has some rare expressions. It can only get difficult due to the words used, other than that the writing style is not hard to follow at all. Recommended to learn formal Japanese words.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_073.jpg) |
| Hard    | 鼻     | Old kanji and old kana usage, very specific buddhist vocabulary with older grammar and vocabulary more generally makes this a challenging read.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_034.jpg) |
| Hard    | 同志少女よ、敵を撃て   | Very involved descriptions of historical war tactics, group movements, and general combat lingo are what makes this difficult. The interpersonal and action scenes tend to be a bit easier in comparison.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_027.jpg) |
| Hard    | 坊ちゃん  | Souseki uses a lot of archaic and rare vocabulary, and some of the example sentences used to explain these words come from Souseki himself (!). It's also sometimes hard to discern whether the narrator (or someone else) is speaking. Nonetheless, his writing largely makes up for it.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_004.jpg) |
| Hard    | 或阿呆の一生| Shorter than the one above, but extremely abstract with weird pacing due to the disconnected nature of the book. It uses old kanji and kana but the main difficulty is how abstract it all is, rather than the sentence length or anything like that.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_061.jpg) |
| Hard    | 舞姫（森鴎外）      | Vocab isn't too difficult, however it'll be difficult to understand for those not familiar with the style of writing. The story is straight forward and quite short, there's also many 解説 available which makes it a good introduction to 文語體.    | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_009.jpg) |
| Hard    | 三国志1-3（吉川英治） | Uses difficult vocab, but its surprising pleasant to read once you get into it. Difficulty mainly comes from keeping track of what's going on, as the perspective is constantly being changed.| ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_024.jpg) |
| Hard-Very Hard | 義血侠血（泉鏡花）    | Outdated, rare words. The writing is hard to follow in general, especially dialogue.      | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_062.jpg) |
| Very Hard      | 十二支考1-12（南方熊楠）     | Old, scholarly writing. References many historical documents, books, etc.   | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_063.jpg) |
| Hell    | 運命（幸田露伴）     | Old. 10/10 vocab difficulty, words that will only show up Chinese dictionaries, made up words, made up 四字熟語 etc, unless you have expansive kanji knowledge it's a struggle. Hard to read in general, especially if you aren't familiar with 文語體, very long sentences. | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_029.jpg) |
| Hell    | 古事記 校註（太安万侶,稗田阿礼）  | Very old style writing, very difficult to decipher. Even with the 校註, you'll likely finish a section having no idea what you just read. Many difficult words, many gods with long names that are hard to keep track of. There's also quite a bit of poetry that, unless you have experience reading old Japanese poetry, is very hard to understand.  | ![](https://ixrec.neocities.org/immersion/novels_files/unnamed_039.jpg) |
